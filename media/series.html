                    <h2>Chuck is a forgotten gem that very few people have had the time to sit down and enjoy it. The T.V series is a hilarious and ironic super spy thriller involving an awkward tech guy who has no idea what he is doing. But its center is about family and proving yourself.</h2>

                    <h2>Stranger Things is popular enough that I don’t have too much to say that hasn’t already been said. It’s incredible! It’s an exceptional horror/coming of age/mystery/drama that is so well written that the average watcher will forget that they are watching television show. It’ll make you cry and then make you lose your mind right after.</h2>

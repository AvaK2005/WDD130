            <h2 class="chuck-msg">Chuck is a forgotten gem that very few people have gotten to sit down and enjoy it. The T.V series is a hilarious and ironic super spy thriller involving an awkward tech guy who has no idea what he is doing.</h2>

            <h2 class="stranger-msg">Stranger Things is an exceptional horror/coming of age/mystery/drama that is so well written that the average watcher will forget that they are watching a show. It’ll make you cry and then make you lose your mind right after.</h2>

            <h2 class="interest-msg">Person of Interest was a series that my dad introduced me to that changed my life a bit. It’s another Spy type story, but this time there is a major AI unit involved that guides the main group on how to save the lives of innocents.</h2>

        [MOVIES Speed Racer is a beautiful Action/Coming of Age film that is built on themes of Hope, relationships, and determination. It’s beautifully colorful and full of whimsical vibes that are the best for a fun family to get together. Everything everywhere all at once is an intense and heartfelt action that pulls you right into the story. The family feels in this film is enough to make a grown man cry, and if not, there is plenty of hilarious and absurd situations to soften even the coldest of hearts. The Truman Show is a movie that stays with you long after you watch it. It’s completely mind-boggling and incredible interesting. It’s hard to put it to words so you’ve just got to watch it and find out.]

        [ANIMATION Fantastic Mr. Fox is a beautiful, animated story brought to us by the director Wes Anderson. It’s a story about self-fulfillment and discovery. The stop motion really brings a fantastic feeling to the entire experience, bringing the film to an entirely new level. ParaNorman is a ironic comedy horror that will make you laugh and scream within the same five seconds. It’s both hilarious and sweet and is perfect for a fun Halloween sit down. Again, in the lovely stop motion style that beings a certain character to the spooky film. Kubo and the two strings in an intense coming of age/action story surrounding a young boy with magic discovering who he is.]

        [T.V SERIES
        Stranger Things is popular enough that I don’t have too much to say that hasn’t already been said. It’s incredible! It’s an exceptional horror/coming of age/mystery/drama that is so well written that the average watcher will forget that they are watching television show. It’ll make you cry and then make you lose your mind right after. Chuck is a forgotten gem that very few people have had the time to sit down and enjoy it. The T.V series is a hilarious and ironic super spy thriller involving an awkward tech guy who has no idea what he is doing. But its center is about family and proving yourself. Person of Interest was a series that my dad introduced me to that changed my life a bit. It’s another  Spy type story, but this time there is a major AI unit involved that guides the main group on how to save the lives of innocents and how to capture the bad guys.]
